# Image Processing <Badge type="tip" text="^0.3.0" />

The `Image` utility class in TransformerPHP provides a set of tools for image processing tasks within the library. While
primarily designed for internal use, it is also accessible for end-users to perform basic image processing tasks. This
page provides an overview of the functionality and usage of the `Image` utility class.

## Image Drivers

The `Image` class is built to work with multiple image processing backends.

- **IMAGICK:** The default image driver used by TransformersPHP. It provides a wide range of image processing functions
  and is the recommended driver for most use cases.
    - Pros: Powerful and feature-rich, with support for a wide range of image formats and operations.
    - Cons: Requires the IMAGICK PHP extension to be installed, which may not be available in all environments.
- **GD:** A simpler image processing driver that is available by default in most PHP installations. It is less powerful
  than IMAGICK but is a good alternative for users who do not have the IMAGICK extension installed.
    - Pros: Widely available and easy to use.
    - Cons: May lack advanced features and performance compared to Vips and Imagick.
- **VIPS:** A high-performance image processing library that is not available by default in PHP installations. It is
  recommended for users who require high-speed image processing and have the VIPS extension installed.
    - Pros: Known for its speed and efficiency, especially for large images.
    - Cons: May require additional installation steps but provides excellent performance.

The image driver can be set using the `setImageDriver()` method in the `Transformers` class. The default driver is
IMAGICK, but you can change it to GD or VIPS based on your requirements.

```php
use Codewithkyrian\Transformers\Transformers;

Transformers::setup()
    ->setImageDriver(ImageDriver::GD)
    ->apply();
```

If you're using the `Image` class directly, you can set the image driver using the `setImageDriver()` method.

```php
use Codewithkyrian\Transformers\Utils\Image;

Image::setDriver(ImageDriver::GD);
```

## Image Processing Operations

The `Image` utility class provides a range of image processing operations that can be performed on images. These
operations include:

- ### `read(string $input, array $options = [])`
  Reads an image from a file path, URL, or resource and returns an image object.

  Parameters:
    - `$input` (string) The path to the image file, a URL to an image, or a file resource.
    - `$options` (array) An array of options to customize the image reading process.

  Returns:
    - An image object representing the input image.

  Example:
  ```php
  $image = Image::read('path/to/image.jpg');
  ```

- ### `fromTensor(Tensor $tensor, string $channelFormat = 'CHW')`
  Creates an image from a tensor (containing the pixel data of the image).

  Parameters:
    - `$tensor` (Tensor) The tensor object representing the image data.
    - `$channelFormat` (string) The channel format of the tensor data. Default is 'CHW'.

  Returns:
    - An image object representing the tensor data.

  Example:
  ```php
  $image = Image::fromTensor($tensor);
  ```

  ```
  
- ### `thumbnail(int $width, int $height, int|Resample $resample = 2)`
    Creates a thumbnail of the image with the specified width and height, using the specified resampling method. This

## Performance considerations

When using the image class for image processing tasks, consider the following performance tips:

- **Use the appropriate image driver:** Choose the image driver that best suits your requirements. IMAGICK is the
  default
  driver and provides a wide range of features, but GD and VIPS may be more suitable for certain use cases. Test
  different drivers to find the one that offers the best performance for your specific tasks.
- **Optimize image processing operations:** Image processing can be computationally intensive, especially for large
  images or complex operations. Optimize your code by minimizing unnecessary operations and using efficient algorithms
  where possible.

  Here are some results for `toTensor` and `fromTensor` operations on a 256x256 image:
  | Operation | IMAGICK | GD | VIPS |
  |---------------|---------|---------|---------|
  | toTensor | 0.0883s | 0.0955s | 0.1271s |
  | fromTensor | 0.0673s | 0.2078s | 0.0683s |

## Interoperability

The Image class seamlessly integrates with other components of the TransformersPHP framework, such as the `Tensor`. You
can leverage this interoperability to perform advanced image processing tasks within your applications.

```php
use Codewithkyrian\Transformers\Utils\Image;

// Read an image
$image = Image::read('path/to/image.jpg');

// Convert the image to a tensor
$tensor = $image->toTensor();

// Perform tensor operations
// ...

// Convert the tensor back to an image
$newImage = Image::fromTensor($tensor);

// Save the new image
$newImage->save('path/to/new_image.jpg');
```
